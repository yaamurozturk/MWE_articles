Modeling Statistical Ididiosyncracy of MWEs

-> Defines mwes as sequences of words that show some level of idiosyncracy which can be semantic or syntactic. 
-> Non-compositionality is similar to idiosyncracy.

-> Lexicalised MWEs -> syntactic 
    institutionalized-> statistical idiosyn. (collocations)
    
  -> They present some earlier methods of MWE extraction focusing on distributional bilingual models of semantics (Hermann, 2012)
  
  -> Presenting anti-collocations from synonyms of the components of an MWE candidate. (which defines MWEhood)
  
  main terms to keep in mind are 
  -> lexicalised and institutionalized mwes
  
  -> Collocational weight (discriminant property for N-N)
  Hypothesis: For a two word compound, head is more likely to co-occur with the modifier than with the synonym of the modifier. 
  -> They worked with a small dataset of around 200 mwes but it is manually annotated for mwes (can make it more correct)
  -> Statistical idiosyncracy == collocational weigth
  -> Evaluation with (probability from frequency independent)
  Multinominal likelihood (mutual dependency of words of a co-occurrence) 
  Mutual Information 
  (performs better)
