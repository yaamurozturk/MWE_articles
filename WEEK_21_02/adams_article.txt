"Multi criterion optimisation for mwe lexicon design promoting lingustic diversity"
(tr->çok sözcüklü fiil ifadeleri sözlük tasarımı için dilbilimsel çeşitliliği yükselten çoklu kriterleri iyileştime)

INTRO AND FORMALISATION
------------------------
Comparison
-----------

-> Kim and Baldwin consider mwe's of pragmatic and statistical nature in their definitions (collocations such as talk freely) 	
-> Parseme does not consider collocations as MWEs. 
-> Both agree on "multi-worditude" and use idiosyncracy/idiomaticity to convey the same idea. 

-> NON DEFINING PROPERTIES (additional properties that are important for the lexicon design) 
K & B 
-----
Crosslingual variation (but they mostly focus on english examples)
Proverbiality
Prosody 

Parseme 
-------
dis-Continuity
Regular Variability
Literal-idiomatic ambiguity 



PROPERTIES ((mentioned as especially important) 
-----------

Variability (focus on complexity)
------------
->Mwes can appear in numerous forms so just focusing on the lemmas (which would be the case of representation in a normal dictionary) would be diminuitive. 
->Components can be found in different forms orders and different syntactical relations.


Discontinuity (we dont know the level of complexity is needed to represent NL) 
-------------
-> Components can be adjacent or can have a word or set of words between them. 
-> So how to describe the possible insertions?
-> What level of "expressivity" is necessary to define natural language, natural language is mildly context sensitive 
-> but not all context sensitive languages are created equally
->complexity level of NL is dependent on the language 
**read about context sensitivity ([32] S. M. Shieber. Evidence against the context-freeness of natural language.
In Philosophy, language, and artificial intelligence, pages 79–89. Springer,
1985.)

SO -> -I need to understand time complexity measures for this part-

We dont know what level of complexity is needed to represent NL and the need for this is to represent
insertions in MWE (so it is a problem of discontinuity) 

less expressive grammars -> better guarantee regarding the time needed necessary to parse a sentence.
(regular grammars: linear/mildly context sensitive: polynomial/non-decidable: infinite time possible)
more expressive grammars -> can handle more complex sentences without relying on simplifications

Literal-idiomatic ambiguity
---------------------------

Very important, since the same composants of mwes can appear in a sentence without showing idiosyncracy/idiomaticity
renders identification difficult


MWE-to-MWE distinction (addition to what is and isnt a mwe, focusing on the question how two mwes can be distinguished between each other) 
he proposes some theories from understanding the lexeme to mwe occurences

-> do they have the same meaning or function
-> are they composed of the same lexicalised lexemes
-> do they share their restrictive and defective properties*

restrictive: idiomatic occurence cannot appear in certain ways (idiomatic - non idiomatic/ he kicked the bucket (both ways)
defective: idiomatic occurence appears in a way which is usually prohibited (idiomatic - ungrammatical / by and large by and narrow)

These two properties can affect the paradigm of each individual lexeme of a MWE
-> these tasks tell us what is needed in a lexicon in order to be able to recognize mwes efficiently.
