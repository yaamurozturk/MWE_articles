A wind of change: detecting and evaluating lexical semantic change across times and domains
-> about semantic change (sense) across time and domains. 
-> Diachronic lexical semantic change detection: detection of word sense changes over time 
-> Now existing models perform differently with certain parameters and in this article they compare the performances of existing models 
-> Combinations that change: -Semantic representations
                             -Alignmment techniques 
                             -Detection measures
                             -preprocessing and parameters 
                    
-> They also mention "synchronic task" in which they examine semantic change across domains (i.e. general vs technical language, dialect variations or term extraction)
-> Synthetic datasets don't reflect diachronic change 


Evaluation:
Diachronic Usage Relatedness
-> target words are chosen and examined, data annotated with degree of meaning similarity 
Synchronic Usage Relatedness 
-> target worrds were examined to show domain specific meaning shift 

Methods for meaning representations : 
-> semantic vector spaces 
-> count based vector spaces: PPMI, Singular Value Decomposition, Random Indexing
-> Predictive vector spaces: Skip-gram with negative sampling
