Integrating Morphology with Multi-word Expression Processing in Turkish

-> Description of a MWE processor for preprocessing in Turkish. 
-> They start with explaining why Turkish needs special treatment and the necessity of MWE processing
-> With MWE processing, aim is to identtify segments of text where syntactic structure and semantics of a sequence of words, which can be discontinous, are non-compositional.
-> Marking MWEs reduce multiplicative ambiguity (?) as morphological interpretations of tokens are reduced when they are coalesced into MWEs with one single interpretation.

Problems regarding Turkish: 
-> Substantial use of support verbs with lexicalised direct or oblique objects subject to various morphological constraints.
-> Usage of partial and full reduplication forms of POS 

Related work
-> They explain that frequences of MWEs are too low for statistical extraction
-> Semantic field annotator: lexicon of words and word units, results in high precision but low recall, showing that statistical methods filtering low frequencies do fail
->Interesting Basque specific terminology extraction system that covers MWEs as a subset. (parsing, regex, stats)
-> Disadvantages of rule-based approaches: less flexible, time consuming for big corpus 
-> Suggested method: Hybrid approaches using rule based methods to identify possible mwes in a corpus and then using stats to enhance the results obtained. (eliminating)
what they suggest is that going from more general to less


MWES in Turkish:
-> word structures with productive inflectional and derivational processes
-> Essential 4 forms of MWEs:
  -lexicalised collocations: fixed components
      -hiç olmazsa (lit. if it never is, meaning. at least, cannot change this structure)
  -semi-lexicalised collocations:  some components fixed, some can vary via inflectional and derivational morphology processes, semantics are non compositional 
      -kafayı yemek (lit. eating head, meaning. going nuts, can be changed with inflection, kafayı yedim (i got nuts), kafayı yiyecekler (they will go nuts) 
      possessive agreements markers are not allowed 
  -non-lexicalised collocations
  -mwe named-entities
