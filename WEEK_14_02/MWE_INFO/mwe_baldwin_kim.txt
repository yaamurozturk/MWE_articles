1.3.2 Verbal MWEs: (similar to the typology in shared task) 

   Verb Particle Constructions
   
	-> verb particle constructions: phrasal verbs 
		take off, bring about ..
	->first mention of the "tail" meaning there is a lot of phrasal verbs that are not frequently used which makes
	the task of making a parser with full coverage of this variety. 
	-> words have to lose their meaning to some point (ex. swallow down is not mwe)*
	-> VPC can:
			-inherit its semantics from V and Particle (not idiomatic) 
			-semantics from V ony
			-semantics from Particle only
			-semantics unrelated to V and Paricle
			
			
	1.3.2.2 Prepositional Verbs
	
	-> main difference from VPC is Preposition is TRANSITIVE  (refer to, come across) 
	-> hard to distinguish from verb-preposition combinations 
	
	1.3.2.3 Light Verb Constructions
	
	-> Verb - Noun complement, light meanining that verb sense is bleached, contribution to meaning of LVC 
	is small 
	-> a test to check this can be paraphrasing the LVC with the verbal form of the noun complement
	(take a walk vs walk, fotoğraf çekmek(take a photograph)
	
	-> according to their definition of light verbs, variety accross language can cause problems since light verbs
	are not the same 
	-> most cases light verbs are interchangable often with different semantics 
	(make a call/take a call)
	tr(telefon etmek/telefon açmak)
	lit.(telephone make/do|telephone open) meaning make a call and answer a call or according to inflection second expression can also mean make a call. 
	
	*If we consider LVC's only with light verbs then telefon etmek should be LVC whereas telefon açmak VID because verb 
	açmak (open) loses literal meaning. This shouldn't be considered light because açmak has a semantic importance. 
	
	
	
	
	Light Verbs for reference 
	-------------------------------------
	english 	turkish 	                
	
	do          	olmak(be)					
	give		kılmak(render)				
	have  		etmek(do or make, render)
	make		eylemek(do or make)
	take       	yapmak(do or make) 
			buyurmak ( order)
	--------------------------------------
	
	
	1.3.2.4 Verb-Noun Idiomatic Constructions
	
	-> verb and noun in DIRECT OBJECT POSITION and are semantically idiomatic
	-> these are not the only group that can be semantically idiomatic
	-> difficult to distinguish whether words are used in literal or idiomatic sense, very much dependent on the context
	(make a face, kick the bucket
	
	Decomposable 
	-> spill the beans, can be -some kind of- paraphrased 
	-> tend to be syntactically flexible
	(spill: reveal beans: secret)
	Non-decomposable
	kick the bucket
	-> less syntactically flexible
	
	Turkish examples(?)
	nalları dikmek = kick the bucket (non decomposable)
	lit.(horseshoe erect) 
	kara para aklamak = money laundering so can be composed (kara para: illegally earned money aklamak: showing as if legal
	lit. (dark money acquit) 
	kara has the semantics of illegal and "aklamak" acquiting/bleaching
	
	1.4 Mwe Classification
	in this part there is a lot of reference to nominal types, nominal expressions tend to be fixed and there 
	is no issue of inflection in these cases. 
	
	a fixed verbal expression example in turkish: göz göre göre (lit. eye see(ingly) see(ingly) - meaning blatantly)

Comparison: 
Differences between PARSEME and this article's definitions of MWEs (summarized from Adam's article)

-> Kim and Baldwin consider mwe's of pragmatic and statistical nature in their definitions (collocations such as talk freely) 	
-> Parseme does not consider collocations as MWEs. 
-> Both agree on "multi-worditude" and use idiosyncracy/idiomaticity to convey the same idea. 

-> NON DEFINING PROPERTIES (additional properties that are important for the lexicon design) 
K & B 
-----
Crosslingual variation (but they mostly focus on english examples)
Proverbiality
Prosody 

Parseme (mentioned as especially important in Adam's article) 
-------
dis-Continuity
Regular Variability
Literal-idiomatic ambiguity
