1.3.2 Verbal MWEs: (similar to the typology in shared task) 

   Verb Paricle Constructions
   
	-> verb particle constructions: phrasal verbs 
		take off, bring about ..
	->first mention of the "tail" meaning there is a lot of phrasal verbs that are not frequently used which makes
	the task of making a parser with full coverage of this variety. 
	-> words have to lose their meaning to some point (ex. swallow down is not mwe)*
	-> VPC can:
			-inherit its semantics from V and Particle (not idiomatic) 
			-semantics from V ony
			-semantics from Particle only
			-semantics unrelated to V and Paricle
			
			
	1.3.2.2 Prepositional Verbs
	
	-> main difference from VPC is Preposition is TRANSITIVE  (refer to, come across) 
	-> hard to distinguish from verb-preposition combinations 
	
	1.3.2.3 Light Verb Constructions
	
	-> Verb - Noun complement, light meanining that verb sense is bleached, contribution to meaning of LVC 
	is small 
	-> a test to check this can be paraphrasing the LVC with the verbal form of the noun complement
	(take a walk vs walk, fotoğraf çekmek(take a photograph)
	
	-> according to their definition of light verbs, variety accross language can cause problems since light verbs
	are not the same 
	-> most cases light verbs are interchangable often with different semantics 
	(make a call/take a call)
	tr(telefon etmek/telefon açmak)
	lit.(telephone make/do|telephone open) meaning make a call and answer a call or according to inflection second expression can also mean make a call. 
	
	*If we consider LVC's only with light verbs then telefon etmek should be LVC whereas telefon açmak VID because verb 
	açmak (open) loses literal meaning. This shouldn't be considered light because açmak has a semantic importance. 
	
	
	
	
	Light Verbs for reference 
	-------------------------------------
	english 	turkish 	                
	
	do          olmak(be)					
	give		kılmak(render)				
	have  		etmek(do or make, render)
	make		eylemek(do or make)
	take        yapmak(do or make) 
	--------------------------------------
	
	
	1.3.2.4 Verb-Noun Idiomatic Constructions
	
	-> verb and noun in DIRECT OBJECT POSITION and are semantically idiomatic
	-> these are not the only group that can be semantically idiomatic
	-> difficult to distinguish whether words are used in literal or idiomatic sense, very much dependent on the context
	(make a face, kick the bucket
