Shared task 2018

-> important remark is that they tried unifying the annotation methods for all languages in this task, which is 
not the case for UD and other mwe annotation practices

Different typology from version 2017: 

	->Universal Categories:
	-LVC
	-VID
	
	->Semi Universal
	->IRV
	->VPC
	->MVC
	
-> there is no vpc and irv in turkish, maybe having less categories can be advantegous 

4.2 Inter Annotator Agreement 
Annotation sizes vary a lot, in turkish only 187 sentences were double annotated which is not enough for this 
type of project
	
Evaluation mesures:
	continuity: per mwe score for continuous and discontinous 
	
->continuity: 
TR- istifa edecek (resignation will-do) FR- il s'agit
*Better results for continuous than discontinous. 


->novelty: seen/unseen 
Seen if a mwe with the same multiset of lemmas is annotated at least once in a training corpus
Unseen if not. 
This was calculated with seen-in-train/unseen-in-train/varient-of-train?

->length:
(multi token vs single token) evaluation shows better results for multi token mwes than single token. Note that these words are frequently
written wrong in general and meaning might change. 
Check the annotation guide to see these usages are counted as mwe or is it taken like peut-etre (the examples are still verbs)
they are known as: settled(?)joint verbs(kaynamış birleşik fiiller)

Varsay(mak) (to assume)    lit.(have - count)
Vazgeç(mek) (to give up)   lit.(to put - pass)
Elver(mek)  (permit)       lit.(hand-give) -> if written seperately the meaning changes - el(e) vermek (reveal) lit.(foreign/hand give) 
Öngör(mek)  (forsee)       lit.(before-see)
 
 

 

->variability:
