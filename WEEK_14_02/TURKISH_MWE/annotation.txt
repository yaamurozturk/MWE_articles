Comprehensive Annotation of Mwes in Turkish (mostly contains info about non-verbals) with some references to consistency check to see some examples 
Excluding: named entities 

-annotation: fully manual 
- 11 main mwe categories and 8 named entities
-non compositionality and discontinuity are common challenged among all languages 
-variability of mwe instances are high due to the agglutinative/morphological structure

Categories of Turkish
 
->Nominal Compound: diş macunu (toothpaste) 
->***Duplication MWEs : N -> mal mülk (property property)/V -> gide gele(going coming)/geldim geldim(lit. I arrived I arrived, meaning sth like: ok don't rush me I'm here)
check for verbal examples of this type** (they seperated verbal mwes and duplication from verbal mwes
but there are verbal occurences as examplified above.
->Verbal compound: karar vermek (to decide) v + n 
->Light Verb Construction: (formed with auxilaries to be, to do, to render, to order...) 
->Compound MWEs constructed with determiners (not verbal like her şey (everything) 
->Conjunction MWEs: bu arada (by the way) 
->Formulaic expressions: carries the meaning of well wishing or gratitude (ellerine sağlık: gratitude towards the person who cooked for you)
->Idiomatic expressions: problem here is distinguishing between literal especially automatically
		- ayağa kalkmak (literally: stand up/to protest), context is needed to identify properly


Personal notes

article: probably will not need to refer for future tasks 

Examples for future reference to issues: 
->ayağa kalkmak/ayakta kalmak -> lemma1 : ayak kalk: get up lemma2-> ayak kal -> stay up or prevail
->ortaya koymak/koyam -> lemma1: orta koy/koyam (exhibit) -> lemmatisation is wrong, koyam-a means negative, present both ways in the consistency check 
->aşk olmak/aşık olmak( -> both expressions should have "aşk ol" as lemma but in UD they are shown as two distinct words  
lit. love happen/lover happen, first is idiomatic, meaning "horsefeathers to you" 

(when compared to french) lots of lemmatisation problems, which causes same mwe to be identified differently, probably increases to number of variety but not in a correct way.


consistency check: lemmatisation is not perfect but as an observation: cases of inflection are better lemmatised than temps et personnes
