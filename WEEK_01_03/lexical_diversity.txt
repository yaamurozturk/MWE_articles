Towards a computational model of grammaticalization and lexical diversity

->Languages with complex morphology tend to have longer zipfian tails than languages with simpler morphology.
->Their study focuses on a parallel corpus of 4 languages that differ in morphology.
-> to model the diachronic process of co-occurent words merging into one they present
	- quantitative measure of lexical diversity
	- model of changes in lexical diversity over severaÅŸ generations of merging frequent collocates.
  
  ** Lexical diversity can be measured cross-languages with calculating frequency distributions for parallel texts and approximating the corresponding ZM parameters in a max. likelihood estimation.
  
	
	Two main focus: Fijian and Hungarian as opposites in terms of lexical diveristy
	-> Fijian has higher frequencies towards lowest ranks and shortest tail
	-> opposite for Hungraian
	Zm parameter values (Fijian has highest , HU lowest)
  
  -> issues with this approach
      - grammaticalization algo is oversimplified, no POS tagging?? 
      - only considers bigram frequencies 
  
  
  Notes??
  
  I wonder the frequency of "bigram collocations" that exists in this study that are actually annotated MWEs. Since they don't take into syntax into account, 
  bigrams should be much more general and higher in frequency, i dont exactly understand the concept of bigrams in this study. Does it only mean the words that simply can co-occur?
  If so this study can be definetely applied to mwes which would have lower diversity than general bigrams/collocates.

  *entropy is high in Hungarian, constructions seem similar to turkish, can be compared, exists in parseme 1.1, no consistency check yet)
