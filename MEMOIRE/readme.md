- Diversity measures in multiword expressions, approximation of disparity using non-contextual multilingual word embeddings in multiword expressions: a comparison of word embeddings models on mwes. 

- Non-contextual word embeddings as an estimation disparity among multiword expressions

- A word embeddings approach to estimate diversity of multiword expressions, case study of disparity 

- Diversity measures in linguistics: non contextualized word-embeddings as an approximation of disparity in multiword expressions: 

 1. Introduction with multiword expressions 

- problems in processing mwes (refer to biblio)
-talking about the approximation of the definition of mwes in parseme
    - how this causes problems in languages with high surface variability 
        particular problems in turkish can be referred to with the workshop article 
        these problems can be pointed out because it kind of defines the limits of our diversity measures. (definitely need to refer to adamâ€™s article here) 
    - brief mention of the manual work made to enhance ( also if we can do it with the new corpus) 

 2. Diversity Measures 

- diversity measures, why is it important (zipfian tail etc..) 
and its implementation to language phenomena 
- what is the purpose of quantifying diversity, and do we ignore diversity in nlp 

3. Word embeddings for MWEs

- new corpora annotaed with mtlb and travis 
- quality check with certain mwes ( a list of 25-30 expressions needed)
- for now we will only look at french and german 
- calculating similarity between word-mwe and also mwe-mwe only to see disparity 
    - issue here is that mwe occurrences is not that high, even if we use the bigger corpora. so we can only use very very common mwes like IRVs to have an estimation of similarity in between mwes.
